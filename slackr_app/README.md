# slackr README

###App Description

**slackr** is an attendance taking application for use by Producers (more commonly: Administrators), Instructors, and Students that tracks four different types of attendances: present, late, absent, and excused. 


Producers are responsible for multiple classes and can view the class roster and attendance totals for each. They can also quickly look at flagged students who have multiple absences and tardys.


Instructors have a single class and can view the class roster and attendance totals for the students in their class. They are responsible for taking daily attendance and managing the attendance record past, present, and future for each student.


Students have a read-only view on their current attendance totals from class start to present as well as a daily log of each date record.
